#  Financial Risk Profile Prediction using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning to classify individuals based on their financial risk profile (High, Moderate, Healthy). Using Random Forest, the model learns from demographic, credit, and behavioral data to assess financial risk accurately. The project includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretability using feature importance.

##  Project Objective

To develop a machine learning model that can predict an individual's financial risk profile (Healthy, Moderate, High) based on a variety of financial and personal indicators. The goal is to provide a system that helps banks or financial institutions assess clientsâ€™ risk levels effectively and transparently.

##  Results & Insights

The Random Forest Classifier achieved **over 90% accuracy** on the test dataset, effectively classifying individuals into appropriate financial risk categories.

###  Top Features Influencing Financial Risk:

- Credit Score  
- Income Level  
- Personal Savings Rate  
- Debt-to-Income Ratio  
- Bankruptcy History  

These features play a critical role in determining the financial health of an individual.
